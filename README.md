# Amplifer-Design
Problem Statement

Design an amplifier for 150 gain at 100kHz in its output waveform. Find out its input and output impedances. Draw gain vs frequency response and find out its bandwidth. What is the maximum allowed input and output signal swing to obtain distortion free signal? Further modify this design for a gain of 250. What is the maximum allowed input and output signal swing to obtain distortion free signal in this case? Compare the two cases
