# Amplifer-Design

Designed and analyzed an analog amplifier for a voltage gain of 150 at 100 kHz

– Calculated input and output impedances, plotted gain vs frequency response and determined its bandwidth.

– Modified the design for a gain of 250 and compared both configurations in terms of gain, bandwidth and its output
swing performance.
