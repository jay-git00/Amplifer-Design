# Amplifer-Design
Problem Statement
Design an amplifier for 150 gain at 100kHz in its output waveform. Find out its input and output impedances. Draw gain vs frequency response and find out its bandwidth. What is the maximum allowed input and output signal swing to obtain distortion free signal? Further modify this design for a gain of 250. What is the maximum allowed input and output signal swing to obtain distortion free signal in this case? Compare the two cases 

Designed and analyzed an analog amplifier for a voltage gain of 150 at 100 kHz

– Calculated input and output impedances, plotted gain vs frequency response and determined its bandwidth.

– Modified the design for a gain of 250 and compared both configurations in terms of gain, bandwidth and its output
swing performance.
